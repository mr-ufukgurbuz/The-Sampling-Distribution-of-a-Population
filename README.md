# The-Sampling-Distribution-of-a-Population

I did this project for “Probability and Statistics Course”. I calculated mean and standard deviation of a sample distribution and 
population distribution in R language. Then, I compared these results for sample and population. In addition to these, I drew a relative 
frequency histogram for the sample. So, I saw that the sample and population distributions have got same histogram.
